# Voting Repo

## How to submit your request to vote on specific Aura/Balancer/CVX snapshot

The best way to request to vote on specific snapshot is Github Issue.

Here are simple steps on how to do that:
1. Navigate here [Issues](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-voting/issues)
2. Click `New Issue`
3. Use the following template to request for vote:
```
## Snapshot
https://snapshot.org/#/<voting.space.eth>/proposal/<proposal_id>

## Option to vote for
<Yes/No/Custom choice>

## Authorization
Post a link here to discord channel where voting was approved.
Maybe you can also attach a screenshot if some people don't have access to those channels, but still want to see
if this vote was authorized
```
4. Add tag `voting` to issue so we can filter out those tickets easily
5. Wait until voting executed and ticket is closed
